# Predicting-Life-Expectancy-using-Machine-Learning

1.Problem Description: To predicts the life expectancy of various countries using machine learning algorithm.

Through this project we are trying to predict the life expectancy of various countries based on the data collected from the data repository website of WHO and its corresponding economic data was collected from the united nation website. During data pre-processing, we used various techniques to treat outliers and null values.

After data pre-processing, we tried several machine learning models to correctly predict our target attribute. 

Best model was decided using r-square and root-mean-square as parameters.
